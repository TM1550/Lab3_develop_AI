Simple instructions: washing dishes with baking soda
Baking soda is a great, safe, and inexpensive product that can remove grease and make your dishes shine.

 What you will need:
Baking soda

A dishwashing sponge

Warm water

3 main ways to use it:
1. As a mild abrasive (for heavy soiling and burnt-on dirt)
Perfect for pots, pans, and stubborn stains.

 Gently dampen the sponge with water.

Dip it in the soda to pick up some powder.

Rub the dirty surface like a regular cleaning agent.

 Rinse thoroughly with warm water.

Tip: For dried or burnt grease, pour some warm water into the dish, add soda, and let it sit for 15-20 minutes. After that, it will be much easier to scrub.

2. As a detergent (for everyday washing)
Suitable for plates, glasses, and cutlery.

Pour a small amount of baking soda (about 1 tablespoon) into the bottom of a sink or basin.

Add warm water to create a cloudy solution.

Wash your dishes as usual in this solution.

Rinse with clean water.
